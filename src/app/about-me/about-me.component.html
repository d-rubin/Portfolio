        <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by Software that simplifies my life. So I started taking courses on Udemy and
                quickly realised how much fun it was. To take my skills to a professional level, I decided to train as a
                front-end developer at the Developer Academy.</p>

            <p>There I was able to quickly deepen my knowledge in several individual or group projects and got feedback
                on them in regular code reviews. As a junior frontend developer, I am now looking forward to putting my
                knowledge to the test and would very much like to support you as part of your software team.</p>
